\chapter{Typewriting Conventions}

You will be working with the source files of LaTeX for several months.
So, it is almost as important how the text is laid out in these files
as how good the printed result looks.

Don't let any line be longer than around 70 chars.  Learn the
``auto-fill'' and LaTeX modes, and ``fill-paragraph'' function of
Emacs.

Sentences are spearated by two blanks.  Emacs can then do
sentence-level editing.

Separate the paragraphs with an empty line.

Section headings should appear by themselves on a line.  Leave a blank
line above and below these.

The following are special characters in {\TeX} | : \verb|#&_%[]{}|.
If you must use them, you have to enclose them in either in the
verbatim mode as in \verb/\verb|#&_%[]{}|/ or provide escape sequences
listed below.

In programming opening and closing quotes are the same.  In \LaTeX{},
open quotes are \verb|`| or \verb|``| and the corresponding closing
quotes are \verb|'| or \verb|''|.

It is a good idea to end each of your files with the line \\
\verb|%-eof-|.

% -eof-
