\chapter{Routine Use of {\LaTeX} }

Most documents contain forward references to \verb|\label|s.  So, often we
must latex the files twice.

\section{Document Structure}

The macros \verb|\chapter| are self-explantory.  These also introduce
a line in the table of contents (.toc) file.  The .toc file is generated at
the end of LaTeX processing.  So, to include a table of contents
properly at the beginning of the document, we must latex the files
twice.

The depth of sections that show up in the TOC is set in the
pmthesis.cls file to 3.  You can change this, to say 9, by including
the line \verb|\setcounter{secnumbookdepth}{9}| in thesis.tex.

\section{Lists}

LaTeX has three kinds of lists.  Description list is often better than
enumerate which is better than itemize.

\begin{description}
\item[Braces] \verb|\item {...}| The braces are not nec.
\item[Brackets] \verb|\item []| The brackets not nec.
\end{description}

\section{Figures}

Figures and tables float, often ending up at the top of a page, or
even at the end of the document.  To control this, learn the
\verb|!htb| options of the {\tt figure} environment.  
Figures should be no more than a single page; rework them if
they are not.

Figure \ref{trie} was interactively drawn using {\tt xfig} and
then exported as a .tex file from it.  Typcially, we \verb|\label| the figures
so we can reference it, as we did it here with the label trie, in the
text of the document.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\input{Figures/trie.tex}
\caption{The trie.tex}\label{trie}
\end{figure}

You can include an eps or pdf file generated by any drawing tool.

Each of the \TeX/ \LaTeX{} specific packages {\tt eepic}, {\tt
  pstricks}, {\tt graphicx}, and {\tt tikz} is capable of producing
intricate drawings, but the learning curve is steep.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\input{Figures/observer.tex}
\caption{Observer/Estimator drawn with TikZ [{\tt www.texample.net}].}
\end{figure}

\section{Tables}

Tables should generally be no more than a single page.  But, if you
must have long tables, look up the packages named {\tt tabularx,
  longtable} and {\tt ltxtable}.

\begin{table}[htb]
\centering
\input{Tables/metrictab.tex}
\caption{Size Summaries of the Selected Sniffers}\label{metric}
\end{table}

\section{Inclusion of Source Code of a PL}

Source code can be included in the verbatim mode.  In this mode, the
special characters of \TeX{} are produced as-is.  However, the TAB
characters are ignored.  Indentation should therefore use just blanks.

\begin{verbatim}
#!/bin/bash
# kppp does not correctly set the PPP up.  Here is the fix.
#

fix-ppp() {
    route del -net 0.0.0.0
    route add default gw 130.108.108.8
    route -n
}
\end{verbatim}
