This repo contains the LaTeX code for Orville Bennett's Master's Thesis
(in Physiology) from Wright State University.
Future students in Wright State's Master's in Physiology Program should 
feel free to use it as a resource for their theses.

This was adapted from the CS department's 
[LaTeX Thesis Example](http://www.cs.wright.edu/~pmateti/GradStudents/thesisExample.tbz)
by [P. Mateti](http://www.cs.wright.edu/~pmateti/GradStudents/advice.html). 
It beats MS Word. Hands down.

For a good Intro to LaTeX see the 
[The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/).

Mostly it's just a place for me to store all this out in the open. 
Finally, don't be stupid. Don't plagarize. You will get caught.
